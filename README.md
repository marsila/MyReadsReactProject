# MyReads Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.
We were given the starter template (The goal of this template is to save time by providing a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used), but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project.


## How to run the project

To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* check the website, try to search for a book and change the book's shelf.


## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
